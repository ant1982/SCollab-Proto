# Coding standards

Comment as much as you can, even if it is obvious. This is a good habit to get into early as it allows you to quickly pickup on a project / system if you have to stop working on it for several days / weeks. It also means that anyone should be able to understand how it works, if the comments break down the logic to layman level.
